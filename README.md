(Actually my First "Big" Project and YOU can help me.
And idk... just copy my code and tell me what your thinking of =))

Welcome to my Description.
So, basically i want to firstly build a terminal based rpg thats working with input, if/elif/else, i have thoughts of a level system, currency system and something like defeating Monsters. Later on i want to make this game visual.(Can someonne give me some ideas please?)
But for know i dont know how to do this so i think im going to extend my code much more than i did yet.
